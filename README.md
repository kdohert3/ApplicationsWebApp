<h1>Proposal Description</h1>
<p>We plan on creating a university admissions application. As of right now, there will be three types of users for the application: administrators, counselors, and students. An admin will be able to create/register counselors. Counselors will be linked to a certain school and will be able to view applications submitted to that school and make a decision (accept, reject, waitlist). Students will be able to apply to schools that are part of the University System of Maryland. Additional roles and functionality might be added later. We plan on using tools we learned (or will learn) in class (PHP, HTML, Bootstrap, Javascript, MySQL). We will use other tools if necessary. We may deploy the application to AWS if time allows.</p>
